# Machine Translation
---
This project aims to build a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end machine translation pipeline. The pipeline will accept English text as input and return the French translation. <br><br>
Implemented 5 different architectures: <br>
1) Embedding layer + Bidirectional-GRU <br>
2) Embedding layer with GRU <br>
3) Bidirectional-GRU <br>
4) Vanilla GRU <br>
5) Encoder-Decoder with LSTM <br>
(List is presented in decreasing order of validation accuracy)
